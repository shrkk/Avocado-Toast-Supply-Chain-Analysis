# Avocado-Toast-Supply-Chain-Analysis

Via Datacamp: You find yourself in London, crafting a delectable avocado toast, a dish that has risen dramatically in popularity on breakfast menus since the 2010s. This straightforward recipe requires just five ingredients: a ripe avocado, half a lemon, a generous pinch of salt flakes, two slices of sourdough bread, and a good drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. Most of these ingredients are now staples in grocery stores, and as you will find with this project, that is no small feat!

In this project, you'll conduct a supply chain analysis of three ingredients used in avocado toast using the Open Food Facts database. This database contains extensive, openly-sourced information on various foods, including their origins. Through this analysis, you will gain an in-depth understanding of the complex supply chain involved in producing a single dish.

Three pairs of files are provided in the data folder:

A CSV file for each ingredient, such as avocado.csv, with data about each food item and countries of origin.
A TXT file for each ingredient, such as relevant_avocado_categories, containing only the category tags of interest for that food.
